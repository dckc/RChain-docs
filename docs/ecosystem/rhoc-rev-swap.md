# RHOC/REV Swap

**Definitions:**

- **REV** —> Native token of the RChain platform
- **RHOC** –> Ethereum ERC20 token that acts as a "placeholder" while the main platform is under development


### What will happen?
In Q1 2019 the RChain mainnet will launch. When the mainnet launches, a snapshot will be taken of all RHOC balances, and every holders that holds RHOC at the moment of the snapshot will be issued an equal amount of REV tokens. 

Every 1 RHOC token can thus be thought of as a 'coupon' for claiming 1 REV token at the mainnet launch. 
After the snapshot, RHOC should be expected to be valueless.
