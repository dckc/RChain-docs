# RHOC/REV Swap

**Definitions:**

* **REV** —> Native token of the RChain platform
* **RHOC** –> Ethereum ERC20 token that acts as a "placeholder" while the main platform is under development

### What will happen?

In Q1 2019 the RChain mainnet is scheduled to launch. Our plan is to take a snapshot of all RHOC balances when the mainnet launches. Every holder of RHOC at the moment of the snapshot will be issued an equal amount of REV tokens, available using the same key.

Every 1 RHOC token can thus be thought of as a 'coupon' for claiming 1 REV token at the mainnet launch.
After the snapshot, RHOC should be expected to be valueless.
