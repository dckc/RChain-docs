### The blockchain identity revolution will be tokenized.

LifeID is bringing identity into the modern era with an open-source, blockchain-based identity platform that creates real-world solutions to enable user-controlled and managed identity. Imagine accessing your entire digital world with just a smartphone and the lifeID app. No more remembering different usernames and passwords — just a streamlined, single sign-on experience. The platform can also replace cards and key fobs for access management as well as real-world identifiers such as drivers’ licenses, gym memberships or even diplomas issued by a university.

LifeID and Pithia developed this partnership to provide RChain with one of the missing links for a secure blockchain: unified, user-controlled identity. Our investment and strategic partnership ensures RChain will have a market-ready, scalable identity layer at launch.

### Be local. Everywhere.

DigitalTown is a pioneer in the use of smart city technology and decentralized applications for

cities. They’re also the first public company (OTC: DGTW) to fully adopt blockchain and

commit to RChain. The company provides a web and mobile application that empowers residents, visitors, merchants, and municipalities to work together to create thriving sovereign

local communities. This partnership brings fundamental services via blockchain to consumers in everyday businesses such as restaurant, hotels and other services.

We are focused on investing in the underpinnings of the blockchain 3.0 ecosystem and supporting impactful, real-world use cases for RChain. Nothing is more foundational than the

cities we live in and how we interact with one another!

### The trusted digital identity platform.

Founded by former executives from Microsoft, Oracle and Symantec, Trusted Key is an enterprise digital identity solution that leverages blockchain technology to provide the foundation of digital trust. Highly-regulated enterprises want to bring their customer experience online, but have significant drop-off rates during enrollment due to the cumbersome identity validation process. The Trusted Key platform helps organizations accelerate online customer acquisition by onboarding new users quickly and easily with a verified identity, provide users with a secure and convenient password-less login, and protect users’ accounts from fraudulent transactions.

Together with RChain, Trusted Key’s identity platform will offer organizations a customizable infrastructure that prevents identity fraud, improves security, and enhances their consumers’ experiences, while still meeting business and regulatory requirements.

### The blockchain advertising protocol for complete data transparency.

Lucidity is an LA-based blockchain startup, who aims to improve the authenticity of digital advertising analytics through a neutral, decentralized shared ledger. The company’s blockchain protocol empowers marketers to resolve data discrepancies so billing is faster, fraud is prevented by flagging fake traffic sources, waste is identified, and campaigns are optimized for performance. Lucidity’s scalable infrastructure can handle high processing speeds and privacy needs of digital advertising.

RChain platform will build Lucidity’s products without having to deal with fluctuating fee prices or performance much more reliable and efficient. The partnership will help to provide meaningful and tangible value to the digital advertising space which is evolving very quickly.
