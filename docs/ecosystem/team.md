Seattle University School of Law, and has been with RChain since the
formation of the Cooperative. He has always been an enthusiast of
video games and hopes blockchain technology will enable the creation
of the ultimate global online arcade, in the classical style where
users pay perhaps 25 cents to play a game of their choice once,
forever replacing the "freemium" garbage that has become ubiquitious
with a direct, independent distribution and payment system that is
clear, simple, and fair.
