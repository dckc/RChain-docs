# Introduction

## What is Alvalor?
Alvalor is an attempt to build an **evolutive blockchain ecosystem**. Alvalor is designed from the ground up to be completely modular, to be incredibly adoptable and flexible. The core module is focused only on the transactions layer. Additional functionality (such as privacy features, smart contracting abilities, etc.) are buid on top of that through additional modules.


## About change
In a market as young and dynamic as blockchain technology, new innovations are brought into the market every month and technology that looked promising a year ago looks outdated today. 

Progress in nature, society and technology has always happened through a mix of cooperation and competition. Open markets, where different parties can interact with a minimal set of rules, often create a fertile ground for innovation. On the other hand, heavily regulated markets often cause a whole industry to stagnate.

In the blockchain world major platforms make opinionated design choices and performance trade-offs, leaving the developers and users of their platforms with little choice. Once the platform is chosen, there is something akin to vendor lockin, where they become stuck in a walled garden with predefined rigid rules.


## Less is more
The more freedom from rules exists, the more areas entities can compete or cooperate on. Competition leads to continuous pressure to provide better value, while cooperation enables a thriving exchange of ideas. Creating the optimal breeding ground for blockchain projects, where projects perish or thrive on purely on their own merit, is our ambition.


## What can Alvalor do?

The [core Alvalor library](docs.alvalor.org/core-library) provides a fast and stable transaction layer. On top of this, functionaly is enabled through modular expansion. 

Explore use cases that Alvalor is well-suited to:

- Enabling high-speed, affordable [Microtransactions](docs.alvalor.org/use-cases/microtransactions)
- Creating simple [Conditional Transactions](docs.alvalor.org/use-cases/B)
- Privacy and [Private Transactions](docs.alvalor.org/use-cases/C)
