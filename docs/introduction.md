# What is RChain?**

::: tip Purpose
RChain is a general-purpose smart contracting platform and blockchain. It's aim is to provide a global, distributed and decentralised compute utility with limitless scalability.
:::

In order to achieve this, a fundamentally different model of computation was needed. The technology that underlies RChain is the Rho-calculus, which enables concurrent computation on distributed systems. The RhoVM is at the very heart of the RChain network.

Contract logic on RChain is written in the Rholang language, which represents a barebones abstraction of the Rho-calculus. The platform is secured through a Proof of Stake consensus algorithm: Casper CBC.

### Technology

The most significant technological differentiator between RChain and other blockchain platforms is it's computational model of the Rho-calculus, which is _inherently concurrent_. Key properties that developers are excited about:

* **Concurrent** distributed systems programming
* **Functional** programming language that enables formal verification
* A sophisticated system of sharding and load distribution through **namespaces**

### Governance**

RChain aims to built it's technology openly, together. The main steward of the RChain platform is the **RChain Cooperative**, incorporated in Washington State, USA. The RChain Coop (which we'll often refer to as simply "the Coop") has **members**. Members make governance decisions through voting and the election of board members and other key players. As of October 2018, the Coop has over 1600 members from across the globe.

To become a member, [go here](https://www.rchain.coop/community). To become a member one has to pay a one-time membership fee of $20, and pass KYC verification.

The Coop tries to be as transparent as possible. In particular, a lot of member discussion and debate takes place in [our Discord server](https://discordapp.com/invite/fvY8qhx).

### Economics**

The cryptocurrency associated with the RChain blockchain is called "REV". Transaction costs are expressed in "Phlogiston". These terms can be thought of as similar to "Ether" and "Gas" on the Ethereum platform, respectively.

Since consensus is achieved through PoS validators, there is no notion of 'mining' on RChain. All tokens are minted in the genesis block. Total supply of REV is xxx,xxx,xxx,xxx. **wordsmith a link to [https://github.com/rchain/reference/blob/master/finance/rhoc.md](https://github.com/rchain/reference/blob/master/finance/rhoc.md "https://github.com/rchain/reference/blob/master/finance/rhoc.md")
