# Scalability**

### Rholang
Rholang wraps the Rho-calculus into a Turing-complete programming language. The language is concurrency-oriented and supports internal programmatic concurrency. As a result, RChain is partitioned (sharded) by default, resulting in a network of coordinated and parallel blockchains.

### Scalability through concurrency
Rho-calculus resolves scalability on a fundamental level. Due to the concurrent nature of Rholang, adding more nodes helps load balance the demand. This allows the network to scale linearly while keeping performance, consistency, and code complexity constant.

### Namespaces
Sharding splits one thing into a list of sub-things, but RChain's namespaces look more like URLs than like shards. That makes it possible to do all kinds of things with namespaces that you canâ€™t do with shards.
