# Foundations

Much of the innovations that RChain brings to the world of blockchain and driven by fundamental breakthroughs in distributed systems programming, with the development of the Rho-calculus. Below, find an overview of the most relevant papers and sources underpinning the RChain technology.

## Rho-calculus
::: warning Rho-calculus
the RChain execution model is derived from the syntax and semantics of rho-calculus. The rho-calculus is a variant of the π-calculus that was introduced in 2004 to provide the first model of concurrent computation with reflection. “Rho” stands for reflective, higher-order.

Those unfamiliar with the π-calculus are strongly encouraged to explore it. The π-calculus is the first formal system to successfully model networks where nodes may regularly join and drop from the network. It assumes fine-grained concurrency and process communication i.e. two processes may be introduced by a third process. The rho-calculus extension inherits all of those features and adds reflection.

## Casper CBC
Casper is a family of Proof of Stake consensus protocols, developed in collaboration with Vlad Zamfir.
