Rholang is RChain's social contract language, built on the [rho
calculus](research.md#rho-calculus) foundation.


## Features

  - Fine grain concurrency
  - Spatial pattern matching
  - Tuple-space persistence
  - Reflection
  - Cryptographic hashing and signature validation
  - Capability security through encapsulation

Increasingly, the RChain platform itself is written in Rholang:
